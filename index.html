      <h2>Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs (1937)</h2>
      <p>There is no better movie to start with than the first animated Disney film, Snow White. The movie has it all from a winsome protagonist, goofy sidekicks, and a terrifying-looking villain. The film is most known for the multiplane camera captures scenes of the Evil Queen's castle and creature filled forest. These animation cels captured complex shots, making it one of the most well-known Disney fairy tales to exist. </p>

      <h2>Fantasia (1940)</h2>
      <p>Fantasia is unlike any film Disney has done before. As you watch, you will notice how there is little dialogue and only a few characters. Animators truly had to do a lot of experimenting with the dancing flowers and mushrooms. </p>

      <h2>The Reluctant Dragon (1941)</h2>
      <p>This film was a masterful blend of action and animation in black and white color. The Reluctant Dragon was released during an animator strike where they demanded for better wage and fair labor. </p>

      <h2>The Three Caballeros (1944)</h2>
      <p>The Three Caballeros, like all Disney package films, has its ups and downs. After an early stretch in which Donald watches a few “home movies,” he’s pulled into the action by his fellow caballeros, José Carioca and Panchito Pistoles, and the movie comes to life. Even with its lower budget, The Three Caballeros is delightfully outlandish. The final section, titled “Donald’s Surreal Reverie,” shows the very horny duck drooling after women, and we see the caballeros’ heads on real women’s bodies and other daffy images. Few Disney films are so singularly baffling and charming at once.</p>

      <h2>Cinderella (1950)</h2>
      <p>Cinderella isn’t as fancifully animated as the studio’s earlier efforts, but there are flashes of the hallucinatory quality of the “Pink Elephants on Parade” segment of Dumbo. Consider “Sing, Sweet Nightingale,” a lullaby depicting the young maiden inside the soap bubbles she’s using to scrub the stairs. And few scenes in Disney animation rival the magical climax when Cinderella transforms into a beautiful princess with the help of her Fairy Godmother. Cinderella isn’t groundbreaking, but sometimes the basics are enough.</p>

      <h2>Sleeping Beauty (1959)</h2>
      <p>Sleeping Beauty was the last true masterwork released during Walt Disney’s lifetime. The story is deceptively simple, but the way the animators create moving pictures to mimic medieval-style stained glass is singular. The film’s emotional arc mirrors the effect of the sleeping potion that overtakes Aurora and the denizens of the kingdom: Sleeping Beauty has a dreamlike quality as it drifts from one setpiece to the next until the climactic battle between Prince Phillip and the primally terrifying Maleficent-as-dragon. Disney bet the farm on Sleeping Beauty, and it paid off. This is one of the all-time great animated features, period.</p>

      <h2>One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961))</h2>
      <p>One Hundred and One Dalmatians was a major shift for Disney as the studio’s first animated feature set in the present day. One of its most memorable images is a shot of scads of Dalmatian puppies watching a black-and-white TV set, a nod to the times. The film is also host to one of Disney’s most outlandish, disturbing villainesses, Cruella De Vil, who’s as evil as she sounds. From a visual standpoint, One Hundred and One Dalmatians isn’t as lush or colorful as Sleeping Beauty, but it’s a fun romp in which the technology matches the story.</p>

      <h2>The Jungle Book (1967)</h2>
      <p>While The Jungle Book has painterly touches and great character animation, a crash course in Disney’s animated features must also acknowledge that some of the studio’s films include troubling depictions of nonwhite cultures. The Jungle Book is one such example, indulging in old-fashioned racism and sexism unhesitatingly. On Disney+, there’s a brief warning of offensive content, but the content is still jarring.</p>

      <h2>The Rescuers (1977)</h2>
      <p>The Rescuers was the last true gasp for the elder statesmen of Disney, as they offered this grim adaptation of Margery Sharp’s daring rescue story. Depending on your point of view, this is an exciting adventure in which two mice rescue an orphan from a greedy kidnapper, or it’s a bleak tragedy in which a little girl is so lost that only mice can save her. Either way, The Rescuers boasts impressively dark animated tableaux and fun, off-kilter chemistry between leads voiced by Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor. But as the studio continued leaning into darkness, it wound up alienating some audiences and animators.</p>
    </div>
    <details> <summary>About <i>The Rescuers</i></summary> The film is based on author Margery Sharp's book series. Two mice, a janitor, and co-agent Miss Bianca set out in search of Penny, an orphan girl that is being held prisoner in the Devil's Bayou by treasure huntress.  </details>

      <h2>The Black Cauldron (1985)</h2>
      <p>The Black Cauldron can’t decide if it wants to be an ’80s-era fantasy like Krull or Excalibur, or … you know, a “Disney movie.” On one hand: undead soldiers attacking the good guys. On the other: a chatty comic-relief sidekick asking for “munchies and crunchies.” The Black Cauldron has fertile source material and some memorable images, but it was too schizophrenic to succeed.</p>
